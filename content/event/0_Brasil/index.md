summary: Preesentation in Diálogos Socioambientais
abstract: 'This presentation will address the challenges of using AI in university teaching, particularly in an online environment. The speaker’s perspective is that AI tools can enhance the learning of certain competencies and help approach topics from alternative perspectives. The role of the teacher as a facilitator of learning will be discussed, as well as how AI tools can support the development of specific skills.
The ethical aspects of using these tools in assessment contexts will be highlighted, raising several issues. On one hand, there will be a brief discussion of tools used to detect AI usage in assessment settings and the consequences of improper use of these tools in evaluations. More centrally, the talk will explore the idea that AI should be seen as an ally rather than a tool to be penalized. The competencies that students need to develop will be discussed. In a context where professionals are able to use AI tools in their work, the presentation will aim to answer several questions:
Does it make sense to penalize the use of AI, or should we teach students to use these tools critically and reflectively? As educators, should we punish the use of these tools, or design activities that help students develop critical thinking skills where the use of AI becomes irrelevant? Is it possible to use AI in specific fields without yet having a solid foundation in that subject?
