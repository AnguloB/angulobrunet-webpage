**IP**: Marina Bosque
**Date**: 11/01/2023 to 12/01/2025

To analyze changes related to patterns of psychoactive substance consumption in secondary school students aged 14 to 18 in Catalonia and Madrid during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore their relationship with the accessibility and promotion of alcohol, the specific objectives include:
Describe changes in substance consumption patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare these changes between these two regions.
Describe the accessibility and promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and electronic cigarettes around educational institutions.
Analyze the relationship between this exposure and psychoactive substance consumption in secondary school students during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine if it varies by region.
Explore, through in-depth interviews, other factors that may have influenced the increase or decrease in substance consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic.
