LGBTIQ screens is a research project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation that focuses on studying the representation and reception of LGBTIQ+ characters in Spanish television series available on Subscription Video on Demand platforms. The project aims to understand the characteristics of these representations and their impact on reducing prejudices related to homophobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, and transphobia among different audiences. Additionally, it aims to contribute to the design of educational initiatives that address sexuality and gender issues from a transfeminist perspective.
