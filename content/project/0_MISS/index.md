The Measuring and Improving Student Success (MISS) research group, a newly formed team, focuses on education research with an emphasis on improving online higher education. Its main goal is to understand the factors and dynamics behind student academic success in online learning environments, particularly at UOC. Academic success is defined not only in terms of academic performance but also regarding student well-being, engagement, and social connection throughout their studies. MISS works on three main areas: exploring student expectations of online higher education, studying the digital learning experience, and analyzing student satisfaction with online learning, especially at UOC. Additionally, the group is interested in research methodology in education and the study of inclusivity and diversity in online higher education and related fields.
