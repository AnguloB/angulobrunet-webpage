abstract: There is a current interest in implementing education programmes to reduce prejudice towards gay individuals. This study investigates how adolescents recognise gay stereotypes in characters and how video-on-demand series could be utilised to reduce bias in Spain and Mexico. Six focus groups (Spain (1) gay, (2) heterosexual, (3) LBTQ+; Mexico (4) gay, (5) heterosexual, (6) LBTQ+) are used to explore the main stereotypes, to analyse how they are perceived in serialised fiction and to investigate their potential use in education programmes. The thematic analysis reveals that the primary stereotypes identified by young Mexicans and Spaniards are associated with femininity and perversion, as well as the belief that the main factors that encourage these stereotypes are religion and politics. LBTQ+ participants are also more critical of the depictions than heterosexuals. Education programmes should not only target young people but also engage the individuals and institutions that are close to them..
