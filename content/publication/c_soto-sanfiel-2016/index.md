abstract: 'We present the results of an investigation aimed at observing the preferences on film consumption of European high school students. In the study took part 937 students of both genders (MeanAge = 15.49, SD = 1.24, Female = 56.24%), from eight countries of the region: Italy (63.39%), Spain (10.45%), Germany (7.04% ), Romania (5.44%), Iceland (4.90%), Croatia (4.48%), France (4.26%), and England (3.52%). The students completed a questionnaire on their cinema preferences on 12 different aspects measured through Likert five degree scales (subtitling or dubbing, European vs. American cinema, foreign vs. domestic film, television films vs. feature films, blockbusters vs. independent, famous actors vs. unknown, known vs. unknown directors, specific genres vs. all genres, surrounding sound vs. standard sound, and 2D vs. 3D).
The statistical analysis of the data showed the global cinema preferences of young Europeans and the specific differences between countries on these issues. The main results indicate that students keep strong and unequivocal opinions on the fact that there are differences between USA and European cinemas. They also clearly prefer the USA cinema to the European.
Moreover, the students also maintain intensively negative attitudes to the films from their countries and to the fact of watching dubbed films. However, the youngsters show no clear preferences in other aspects of film consumption (e.g. genres, actors, directors). Finally, the study revealed there were differences in some of these preferences depending on the country. The results of this work could be applied to the design of film literacy programs and interest educators, regulators and members of the audio-visual industries.'
