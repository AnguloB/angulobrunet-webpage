abstract: The emergence of resistance to antibiotics is a serious public health problem
  worldwide and can be a cause of mortality. For this reason, antibiotic treatment
  is compromised, and we have few therapeutic options to treat infections. Ceftazidime-avibactam
  (CZA) has emerged as a promising solution to the lack of new antibiotics against
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Data from in vitro assays of CZA combinations,
  however, are scarce. The objective of our study was to perform a time-kill analysis
  of the effectiveness of CZA alone and in combination with other antibiotics against
  a collection of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa isolates. Twenty-one
  previously characterized representative XDR P. aeruginosa isolates were selected.
  Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution, and results were interpreted
  using CLSI criteria. The time-kill experiments were performed in duplicate for each
  isolate. Antibiotics were tested at clinically achievable free-drug concentrations.
  Different treatment options, including CZA alone and combined with amikacin, aztreonam,
  meropenem, and colistin, were evaluated to identify the most effective combinations.
  Seven isolates were resistant to CZA (MIC ≥ 16/4 mg/liter), including four metallo-β-lactamase
  (MBL)-carrying isolates and two class A carbapenemases. Five of them were resistant
  or intermediate to aztreonam (MIC ≥ 16 mg/liter). Three isolates were resistant
  to amikacin (MIC ≥ 64 mg/liter) and one to colistin (MIC ≥ 4 mg/liter). CZA monotherapy
  had a bactericidal effect in 100% (14/14) of the CZA-susceptible isolates. Combination
  therapies achieved a greater overall reduction in bacterial load than monotherapy
  for the CZA-resistant isolates. CZA plus colistin was additive or synergistic in
  100% (7/7) of the CZA-resistant isolates, while CZA plus amikacin and CZA plus aztreonam
  were additive or synergistic in 85%. CZA combined with colistin, amikacin, or aztreonam
  was more effective than monotherapy against XDR P. aeruginosa isolates. A CZA combination
  could be useful for treating XDR P. aeruginosa infections, including those caused
  by CZA-resistant isolates. IMPORTANCE The emergence of resistance to antibiotics
  is a serious public health problem worldwide and can be a cause of mortality. For
  this reason, antibiotic treatment is compromised, and we have few therapeutic options
  to treat infections. The main goal of our study is to search for new treatment options
  for infections caused by difficult-to-treat resistant germs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  is a Gram-negative bacterium distributed throughout the world with the ability to
  become resistant to most available antibiotics. Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) emerged
  as a promising solution to the lack of new antibiotics against infections caused
  by P. aeruginosa strains. This study intended to analyze the effect of CZA alone
  or in combination with other available antibiotics against P. aeruginosa strains.
  The combination of CZA with other antibiotics could be more effective than monotherapy
  against extensively drug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains.
