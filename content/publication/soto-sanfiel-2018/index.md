abstract: Within the framework of the Creative Europe programme, and due to the inexplicable
  lack of current academic information on the topic, this exploratory cross-cultural
  study seeks to advance the understanding of the relationship between European adolescents
  and cinema through a sample of 937 secondary students from eight countries of the
  European Union. Specifically, the research contributes to the identification of
  young people’s conceptions of the artistic value and functions of cinema, their
  knowledge of cinematography and their opinions about national, European or foreign
  cinema. In addition, it explores the extent to which these factors are alike and
  differ according to nation. The results of this work are relevant for academics
  from different disciplines, regulators, educators and members of the audiovisual
  industry.
