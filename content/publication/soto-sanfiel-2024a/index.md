abstract: 'This experimental study examines the impact of gay stereotypes on Spanish university students’ attitudes. Five hundred thirty eight participants shared their experiences with gay individuals and completed a homophobia scale before or after viewing stereotypical and neutral depictions of gay characters. The findings reveal low homophobia levels and a preference for neutral portrayals. Realism, identification, and enjoyment influenced perceptions, along with interpersonal contact. Homophobia influenced familiarity and perceived accuracy of stereotypes. These results emphasize receivers’ active role in interpreting LGBTQ + stereotypes in fiction, shed light on associated psychological processes, and highlight audience variability in susceptibility to such portrayals, contributing to stereotype and cultivation research.'
