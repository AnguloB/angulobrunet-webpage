abstract: One of the psychological responses to audiovisual fictions that has been
  receiving more attention recently is appreciation, defined as a reflexive eudaimonic
  gratification obtained from a meaningful entertainment mode. Appreciation is the
  perception that the media experience has a profound meaning, has taught or revealed
  something. This study seeks to advance on the understanding of appreciation by youngsters.
  It translates and adapts the Oliver and Bartsch’s questionnaire for teenagers of
  three European countries. A total of 213 Italians, 55 Spaniards and 42 Germans watched
  a drama film and immediately afterwards answered the questionnaire. The results
  of confirmatory factor analysis suggest the existence of four first-order factors
  for each country. The multi-group analysis shows the questionnaire is not invariant
  across groups. Thus, the concept of appreciation in its current formulation is not
  universal. Instead, it seems to be dependent on the cultural aspects of the audience.
  This article discusses the implications of such results for the understanding of
  appreciation and of teenagers’ media responses. It also reports mean comparisons
  for the invariant parameters.
