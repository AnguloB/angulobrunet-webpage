abstract: 'This study aims to shed light on adolescents’ characterizations of their
  preferred film entertainment. It seeks to describe the psychological responses of
  youngsters from two European countries (Italy and Spain) to dramas from the European
  region about current social/human issues. The study also seeks to determine if the
  adolescents’ responses differ according to the film and the cultural context (country)
  to which they belong. For doing so, the research applies an innovative visual research
  technique in Media Communication: a correlational network analysis. A total of 234
  Italian and Spanish adolescents watched three European dramas. Later, they completed
  four questionnaires measuring hedonic (enjoyment), eudaimonic (appreciation) responses
  and predictors of them (narrative engagement and perceived realism). The results
  present the visual intercorrelations of the studied variables, which give deeper
  insights into youngsters’ gratifications in film consumption. These results suggest
  that films appear to be more influential than country in adolescents’ responses.
  They also show there are specific models of responses for each film in each situation.
  The application of the visual quantitative tool broadens our knowledge on adolescents’
  entertainment through dramatic film and on the role of the cultural context and
  the audiovisual stimulus in the entertainment responses. It also challenges empirical
  studies using a single stimulus.'
