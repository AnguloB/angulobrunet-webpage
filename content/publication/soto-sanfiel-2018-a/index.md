abstract: We present the results of an exploratory study framed within a large film
  literacy project carried out simultaneously in five European Union countries (Croatia,
  France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). The study looks at students’
  responses to an educational project on cinema designed to be implemented regionally
  for five months in high schools to increase film literacy and to favour more positive
  attitudes towards European cinema. The results show that students’ film preferences
  remain stable after the programme and vary only slightly. Major changes occur in
  their knowledge about film production and expression. The aspects that change the
  least are their conceptions about cinema and their preferences. Moreover, the student
  attitudes towards national and European cinema are more positive. However, the results
  also show that the implementation of a film literacy programme at a cross-cultural
  level can affect different aspects depending on the cultural context (country) in
  which it occurs. Indeed, they provide data about the specific impact of the programme
  in each country. The information offered by this study could enhance film literacy
  programmes, inform theory, and nurture the debates about the common European identity
  and the particular traits of the diverse cultures of the European Union.
