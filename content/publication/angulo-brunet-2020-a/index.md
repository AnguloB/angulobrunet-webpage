abstract: 'Background: Measuring complex constructs, such as those from self-determination
  theory models, is challenging in the elderly due to the response process, particularly
  in collective data gathering. In order to examine this construct in physical activity
  settings we aimed at determining whether single-item measures were as good as pre-existing
  multi-item measures. For that reason, we developed seven single-item measures targeting
  perceived interpersonal styles, basic needs satisfaction, and well-being. Method:
  We gathered evidence of validity and reliability for multi-item measures and single-item
  measures based on a sample of 128 elderly adults. Another sample of 62 elderly adults
  provided test-retest reliability for the single-item measures. Results: Favourable
  evidence of the expected internal structure, concurrent validity, and reliability
  was obtained for competence-and relatedness-supportive styles, and for satisfaction
  of the basic psychological need of relatedness, fairly good evidence was obtained
  for subjective vitality, whereas mixed evidence was obtained for autonomy-supportive
  style and the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of autonomy and competence.
  Conclusions: Single-item measures proved to be psychometrically sound substitutes
  for their multi-item counterparts, but the autonomy constructs need to be reconsidered.
  Furthermore the response process and consequences of testing should play a prominent
  role when devising questionnaires for the elderly.'
