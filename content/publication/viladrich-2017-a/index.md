abstract: 'Based on recent psychometric developments, this paper presents a conceptual
  and practical guide for estimating internal consistency reliabil-ity of measures
  obtained as item sum or mean. The internal consistency re-liability coefficient
  is presented as a by-product of the measurement model underlying the item responses.
  A three-step procedure is proposed for its estimation, including descriptive data
  analysis, test of relevant measure-ment models, and computation of internal consistency
  coefficient and its confidence interval. Provided formulas include: (a) Cronbach’s
  alpha and omega coefficients for unidimensional measures with quantitative item
  re-sponse scales, (b) coefficients ordinal omega, ordinal alpha and nonlinear reliability
  for unidimensional measures with dichotomic and ordinal items, (c) coefficients
  omega and omega hierarchical for essentially unidimension-al scales presenting method
  effects. The procedure is generalized to weighted sum measures, multidimensional
  scales, complex designs with multilevel and/or missing data and to scale development.
  Four illustrative numerical examples are fully explained and the data and the R
  syntax are provided.'
