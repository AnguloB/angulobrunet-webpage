abstract: "The purpose of the present study is to review recent interventions aimed\
  \ at promoting physical activity using self-determination theory (SDT) framework.\
  \ We present evidence-based proposals that researchers could find useful to develop\
  \ their own interventions. Our narrative review includes journal articles published\
  \ between 2011 that meet the following inclusion criteria: (a) using SDT as reference\
  \ framework, (b) targeting healthy participants with age ≥ 12 years old, and (c)\
  \ pursuing a main goal of promoting physical activity or related variables. Results\
  \ are presented in three categories: (a) structure, theoretical approach and general\
  \ aspects of the intervention, (b) development, and (c) assessment. Regarding the\
  \ structure, two types of interventions emerged: those conducted within an existing\
  \ setting, where professionals in charge receive specific training that is expected\
  \ to indirectly affect their students/patients; and interventions developed from\
  \ zero, where participants receive direct training or information. Results showed\
  \ that the most common background to develop SDT interventions is autonomy support\
  \ and autonomy satisfaction. Concerning the development of the intervention, it\
  \ appears essential to understand the needs of the target population and to develop\
  \ tailored interventions that consider SDT not only as concepts to explain but also\
  \ as a way of thinking that guides the development of the interventions. Regarding\
  \ the assessment of the intervention, researchers could consider (a) using mixed-methods\
  \ approach, (b) including objective and self-reported measures and (c) measuring\
  \ participants' satisfaction with the intervention."
