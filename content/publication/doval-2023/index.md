abstract: 'Background: During the 20th century the alpha coefficient (a) was widely
  used in the estimation of the internal consistency reliability of test scores. After
  misuses were identified in the early 21st century alternatives became widespread,
  especially the omega coefficient (ω). Nowadays, α is re-emerging as an acceptable
  option for reliability estimation. Method: A review of the recent academic contributions,
  journal publication habits and recommendations from normative texts was carried
  out to identify good practices in estimation of internal consistency reliability.
  Results: To guide the analysis, we propose a three-phase decision diagram, which
  includes item description, fit of the measurement model for the test, and choice
  of the reliability coefficient for test score(s). We also provide recommendations
  on the use of R, Jamovi, JASP, Mplus, SPSS and Stata software to perform the analysis.
  Conclusions: Both a and ? are suitable for items with approximately normal distributions
  and approximately unidimensional and congeneric measures without extreme factor
  loadings. When items show non-normal distributions, strong specific components,
  or correlated errors, variants of ? are more appropriate. Some require specific
  data gathering designs. On a practical level we recommend a critical approach when
  using the software.'
