abstract: 'The aim of the study is to assess a mediational pathway, which includes
  patients’ sex, personality traits, age of onset of gambling disorder (GD) and gambling-related
  variables. The South Oaks Gambling Screen, the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) and
  the Temperament and Character Inventory-R were administered to a large sample of
  1632 outpatients attending a specialized outpatient GD unit. Sociodemographic variables
  were also recorded. A Structural Equation Model was adjusted to assess the pathway.
  Age of onset mediated between personality profile (novelty seeking and self-transcendence)
  and GD severity and depression symptoms (measured by SCL-90-R). Sex had a direct
  effect on GD onset and depression symptoms: men initiated the GD earlier and reported
  fewer depression symptoms. Age of onset is a mediating variable between sex, personality
  traits, GD severity and depression symptoms. These empirical results provide new
  evidence about the underlying etiological process of dysfunctional behaviors related
  to gambling, and may help to guide the development of more effective treatment and
  prevention programs aimed at high-risk groups such as young men with high levels
  of novelty seeking and self-transcendence.'
