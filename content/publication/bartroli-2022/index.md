abstract: In order to assess emotional competence in children, it is necessary to
  have psychometrically sound measures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
  available tool to assess emotional competence in children from 3 to 5 years old
  that assesses the five emotional competences of the Bisquerra model and can be easily
  and quickly answered in the school environment. The objective of this study is to
  develop a measure, the Emotional Competence Assessment Questionnaire (ECAQ), and
  to provide evidence of its psychometric quality. Qualitative evidence was obtained
  from a systematic review, from two expert committees and from five discussion groups.
  On the other hand, quantitative validity and reliability evidence was obtained from
  a sample of 1088 students and other smaller subsamples. The results suggest that
  the ECAQ is a short and easy-to-use tool, easily understood by administrators. The
  quantitative results confirm a general factor of emotional competence adjusted for
  three specific factors. This factor has excellent internal consistency and test-retest
  reliability. The ECAQ has therefore been shown to be a promising tool for assessing
  emotional competence in children between 3 and 5 years of age.
